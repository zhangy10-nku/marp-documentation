## Good Software Design

### Kevin's Personal Rules for High-Quality Software

#### **Rule 1: Automation is Non-Negotiable**
[If you can't automate the quality checking and testing of your project, it should not go beyond a development environment.](Rule%201.md)

*Quality gates must be automated—linting, testing, security scanning, and deployment pipelines are the foundation of production-ready software.*

---

#### **Rule 2: Continuous Integration of Code and Knowledge**
[Merge often. Review often. Refactor often.](Rule%202.md)

*Keep your codebase healthy through frequent integration. Small, regular merges prevent merge hell, code reviews share knowledge across the team, and continuous refactoring prevents technical debt from accumulating.*

---

#### **Rule 3: Ship Early, Learn Fast**
**MVP ASAP.**

Get a Minimum Viable Product into users' hands as quickly as possible. Real-world feedback beats theoretical planning every time. Iterate based on actual usage, not assumptions.

---

#### **Rule 4: Collaboration Amplifies Solutions**
**Bounce ideas. Be social. Seek to understand different perspectives and what problems they solve.**

Great software emerges from diverse viewpoints. Engage with your team, understand why different approaches exist, and learn from the problems others have solved. No one has all the answers alone.

---

#### **Rule 5: Users Are Your North Star**
**Talk with users often. Get feedback as soon as possible. Be responsive. Understand needs.**

Your users define success. Regular communication ensures you're building what actually matters. Quick feedback loops and genuine understanding of user needs prevent wasted effort and missed opportunities.

*These rules emphasize quality, collaboration, and user-centricity as the pillars of successful software development.*
